jaisalab: A Toolkit for Safe RL
-------------------------------

jaisalab is a framework for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms that take into account constraints that should be satisfied in OpenAI gym environments, that also provides PyTorch implementations for a few state-of-the-art algorithms in Constrained RL. 
Namely, the algorithms implemented are `Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO) <https://github.com/jaimesabalimperial/jaisalab/blob/master/jaisalab/algos/cpo.py>`_, the `Safety Augmented RL (SAUTE) <https://github.com/jaimesabalimperial/jaisalab/blob/master/jaisalab/envs/saute_env.py>`_ wrapper that incorporates safety to any RL algorithm in a plug-n-play manner, and **Distributional Constrained Policy Optimization**, a modification to CPO that exploits uncertainty in the cost value function to better satisfy constraints. 

The framework builds on the `garage <https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage>`_ toolkit to add functionality to safe RL settings (i.e. where there is a cost associated with each state-action pair on top of the reward) and thus provides an auxiliary set of modular tools for implementing constrained RL algorithms, analogously to how **garage** provides these for regular RL settings. 

Running Unit and Integration Tests
----------------------------------

This project uses pytest for unit and integration testing (included in the 
developer dependencies). The tests may be run from the root directory as 
follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytest
    ...
    ===== x passed, x warnings in x.xx seconds =====


Instructions for Experiment Reproduction
----------------------------------------

The final results for DCPO, Saute TRPO, Vanilla TRPO, and CPO showed in the final report are equivalent to the experiments in `jaisalab.experiments.backlog <https://github.com/jaimesabalimperial/jaisalab/blob/master/jaisalab/experiments/backlog.py>`_, ran across seeds 1-10. The evaluation of the trained algorithms is done through the SeedEvaluator object for 30 epochs and the plots are made using the methods of the RLPlotter object. 

References
----------

The code implementations for the algorithms present in **jaisalab** are based partly or fully on the repositories of their respective papers. For **CPO**, the original TensorFlow implementation can be found in `here <https://github.com/jachiam/cpo>`_, but this had to be translated to PyTorch to fit our framework. For **SAUTE**, the implementation was much more straightforward since it's simply a wrapper around the environment, rather than a separate algorithm that should fit our framework as a whole, so the code present in **jaisalab/envs/safe_env** and **jaisalab/envs/saute_env** was taken directly from `Huawei's repository <https://github.com/huawei-noah/HEBO>`_ (more specifically `here <https://github.com/huawei-noah/HEBO/tree/405dc4ceb93a79f0d1f0eaa24f5458dd26de1d05/SAUTE/envs/wrappers>`_).
